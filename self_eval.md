# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    I am proud of being able to logically work through the `defining methods` problems. They were challenging and I found it fun!

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    Using methods allows us to work more efficiently. By setting up methods we can complete tasks more quickly by automating them.
